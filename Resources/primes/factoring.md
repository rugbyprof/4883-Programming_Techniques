Factoring a number into two prime numbers is a central problem, especially in the context of RSA encryption where the security is based on the difficulty of factoring a large semiprime (a number that's the product of two prime numbers) back into its constituent primes. 

Here are some strategies to factor a number into two primes:

1. **Brute Force**:
   - Start from the smallest prime (i.e., 2) and divide the given number.
   - If it divides evenly, check if the quotient is also prime.
   - This method is very slow and is impractical for large numbers.

2. **Pollard's rho algorithm**:
   - A probabilistic factorization algorithm, which outputs one non-trivial factor of the number.
   - This algorithm is particularly effective on numbers with small factors.
   - If the found factor is prime, then the quotient will be the other prime factor.

3. **Fermat's Factorization Method**:
   - Based on the representation of an odd integer as the difference of two squares.
   - For a number \( n \), try to express it as \( n = a^2 - b^2 \).
   - If such \( a \) and \( b \) are found, then \( n \) can be factored as \( (a+b)(a-b) \).
   - It's efficient if the two prime factors of \( n \) are close to each other.

4. **Quadratic Sieve**:
   - One of the fastest known algorithms for factoring large numbers.
   - It's based on the principle of Fermat's method but uses quadratic forms.
   - More efficient than Fermat's method, especially for semiprimes.

5. **Elliptic Curve Factorization**:
   - Uses properties of elliptic curves to find factors.
   - Can be faster than quadratic sieve for numbers of certain sizes.

6. **General Number Field Sieve (GNFS)**:
   - The most efficient known method to factor very large numbers.
   - Highly complex and involves both algebraic number theory and lattice basis reduction.

7. **Special Number Field Sieve (SNFS)**:
   - A variant of GNFS but is efficient for numbers that have a special form.

For many applications, a combination of the above methods is used. For instance, trial division might be used to quickly identify small factors, after which a more complex algorithm like the quadratic sieve or elliptic curve factorization is employed for the larger factors.

When factoring a number known to be a product of two primes (like in RSA), once one prime is found, the other can be quickly determined by a simple division. However, factoring such numbers becomes computationally difficult as the numbers increase in size, which is why it's used as the foundation for cryptographic security in systems like RSA.
