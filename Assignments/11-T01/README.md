## Midterm Exam

#### Due: 10-17-2024 (Thursday)

Midterm will consist of two problems to be completed in class in one hour and twenty minutes. I will assign everyone 1 easy and 1 medium problem to complete. Everyone may get the same problems, or I may randomly assign each person their own two problems. The problems to study are listed below and are a mix of problem paradigms.

You can work on the following problems, obviously, but do not get them accepted by LeetCode. If you do, I will use one of the unknown problems I listed in each category for you to solve. The unknown problems can also be used in other situations which I find necessary.

With the ease of finding solutions for LeetCode and Uva Online judge, I simply do not know a better way to assess individual progress for this class. I'm sure you can understand the ease in which to find solutions, even when logged into LeetCode, forcing my hand. **I am 100% open to suggestions, and comments about the current status and workload of the course. **
