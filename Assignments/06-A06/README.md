## Assignment 6 - Hardwood Sneezy

#### Due: 12-06-2024 (Last Day of Class)

## Assignment Overview

These problems focus on counting frequencies or selecting the top/bottom `K elements`, using `heaps`, `priority queues`, and `sorting`, which are core strategies shared with LeetCode 692.



## Requirements

Choose 1 of the following:

- [LeetCode 692: Top K Frequent Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)
- [LeetCode 347: Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)
- [LeetCode 451: Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)
- [LeetCode 973: K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)
- [LeetCode 1046: Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

## Problem Descriptions

1. **LeetCode 347: Top K Frequent Elements**  
   This problem is highly similar, but instead of words, you are asked to find the top K most frequent numbers in an array. The approach to solve both problems (using hash maps and heaps) is nearly identical.

2. **LeetCode 451: Sort Characters By Frequency**  
   This problem involves sorting characters in a string by their frequency of occurrence, much like counting word frequencies and sorting them in LeetCode 692.

3. **LeetCode 973: K Closest Points to Origin**  
   Though this problem focuses on finding the closest K points to the origin in a 2D plane, the "top K" concept is shared, making it similar in algorithmic approach (heap/priority queue usage).

4. **LeetCode 1046: Last Stone Weight**  
   In this problem, you're tasked with repeatedly picking the two heaviest stones and smashing them together. It involves frequent sorting and selection, similar to extracting top elements in the "Top K" problems.

## Submission

- Make sure you put a folder called A06 in your Assignments folder.
- Of course make a readme based on [HERE](/Users/griffin/Sync/__currentCourses/4883-Programming_Techniques/Resources/03-Readmees/README.md)
- Ensure you get a problem accepted by Leetcode that you can feel good about submitting (its mostly your solution).
