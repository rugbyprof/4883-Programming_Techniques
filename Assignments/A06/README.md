### Hardwood Species

- The trauma of reading this input is still with me. 
- However, this is a good example of using STL Maps Vectors and Pairs as part of the solution.

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A06` in your `assignments` folder.
- Place the pdf, your solution code, and any input files you used in this folder.

- Commit this content to your github repo by the due date.
