### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `P`(problem_number) in your `assignments` folder.
- Place the pdf, your solution code, and any input files you used in this folder.
- Make sure you create an acceptable [README](../../Resources/03-Readmees/README.md) file for this project (presentation is everything!)
- Commit this content to your github repo by the due date.

1. **[UVa 100 - The 3n + 1 problem]**: The closest LeetCode problem is **[LeetCode 128 - Longest Consecutive Sequence]**. This problem deals with finding sequences, which shares similarities with the idea of cycle lengths in the 3n + 1 problem.

2. **[UVa 272 - TEX Quotes]**: Look at **[LeetCode 125 - Valid Palindrome]**, which involves string manipulation. While not exactly the same, students will practice parsing and modifying strings.

3. **[UVa 575 - Skew Binary]**: A comparable problem on LeetCode would be **[LeetCode 67 - Add Binary]**, where binary operations and conversions are key to solving the problem.

4. **[UVa 10035 - Primary Arithmetic]**: You could refer to **[LeetCode 2 - Add Two Numbers]**, which also involves handling addition of large numbers, albeit represented differently.

5. **[UVa 10055 - Hashmat the Brave Warrior]**: **[LeetCode 7 - Reverse Integer]** is similar in its need to handle and manipulate integers, though the problem context differs slightly.

6. **[UVa 10071 - Back to High School Physics]**: While not a direct equivalent, **[LeetCode 62 - Unique Paths]** could be a way to practice with physical movements across grids or paths.

7. **[UVa 10302 - Summation of Polynomials]**: For polynomial-like summations, **[LeetCode 11 - Container With Most Water]** involves summation techniques applied in a geometric context.

8. **[UVa 10346 - Peter's Smokes]**: The logic behind counting actions similar to recursion or iterations could be compared to **[LeetCode 191 - Number of 1 Bits]**.

9. **[UVa 10370 - Above Average]**: **[LeetCode 66 - Plus One]** could help students develop basic arithmetic and comparison skills.

10. **[UVa 10773 - Back to Intermediate Math]**: You might look into **[LeetCode 69 - Sqrt(x)]**, as both involve math operations that require approximation techniques.

11. **[UVa 10783 - Odd Sum]**: This problem involves calculating the sum of odd numbers in a range, which is similar to **[LeetCode 1523 - Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range]**. The logic of finding and summing odd numbers between two boundaries is closely related.

12. **[UVa 10931 - Parity]**: The task of finding the parity (whether the number of `1`s in the binary representation of a number is odd or even) is very similar to **[LeetCode 191 - Number of 1 Bits]**, where the goal is to count the number of `1`s in the binary form of a number.

13. **[UVa 11044 - Searching for Nessy]**: This problem involves dividing a grid into sections, and a close problem in LeetCode could be **[LeetCode 221 - Maximal Square]**, which deals with partitioning or working with grids.

14. **[UVa 11172 - Relational Operator]**: This is a basic comparison problem where you determine if one number is less than, greater than, or equal to another. **[LeetCode 1365 - How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number]** deals with comparisons and rankings between numbers.

15. **[UVa 11498 - Division of Nlogonia]**: While there's no exact equivalent, **[LeetCode 53 - Maximum Subarray]** has a somewhat similar concept of partitioning space and working with boundaries in a more abstract sense.

16. **[UVa 11547 - Automatic Answer]**: This problem involves performing a series of arithmetic operations on a number, similar to **[LeetCode 9 - Palindrome Number]**, which also involves manipulating digits and performing checks.

17. **[UVa 11614 - Etruscan Warriors Never Play Chess]**: This problem is about solving a quadratic equation, similar to **[LeetCode 367 - Valid Perfect Square]**, where number properties and mathematical problem solving are involved.

18. **[UVa 11636 - Hello World!]**: This is a counting problem involving powers of two, which can be loosely compared to **[LeetCode 50 - Pow(x, n)]**, where you calculate powers of numbers.

19. **[UVa 11727 - Cost Cutting]**: In this problem, you are given three numbers and need to return the second-largest, which corresponds well to **[LeetCode 414 - Third Maximum Number]**, where the goal is to find the third maximum but can be adapted for second-largest as well.

20. **[UVa 11764 - Jumping Mario]**: This problem involves counting "jumps" based on height differences, which is similar in logic to **[LeetCode 55 - Jump Game]**, where you calculate possible jumps based on conditions.
