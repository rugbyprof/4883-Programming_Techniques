## Assignment 4 - Easy Breezy

#### Due: 12-06-2024 (Last Day of Class)

### Overviews

Look. These are easy breezy. Do 10 of these.

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `P`(problem_number) in your `assignments` folder.
- Place the pdf, your solution code, and any input files you used in this folder.
- Make sure you create an acceptable [README](../../Resources/03-Readmees/README.md) file for this project (presentation is everything!)
- Commit this content to your github repo by the due date.

1. [LeetCode 128 - Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/Longest-Consecutive-Sequence/). This problem deals with finding sequences, which shares similarities with the idea of cycle lengths in the 3n + 1 problem.

2. [LeetCode 125 - Valid-palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/Valid-palindrome/), which involves string manipulation. While not exactly the same, students will practice parsing and modifying strings.

3. [LeetCode 67 - add binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/), This is a binary representation-related problem. Although it differs slightly, the logic of working with non-standard binary systems overlaps.

4. [LeetCode 2 - Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/), which also involves handling addition of large numbers, albeit represented differently.

5. [LeetCode 7 - Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/) is similar in its need to handle and manipulate integers, though the problem context differs slightly.

6. [LeetCode 62 - Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/Unique-Paths/) could be a way to practice with physical movements across grids or paths.

7. [LeetCode 11 - Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) involves summation techniques applied in a geometric context.

8. [LeetCode 191 - Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)The logic behind counting actions similar to recursion or iterations

9. [LeetCode 66 - Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/Plus-One/) could help students develop basic arithmetic and comparison skills.

10. [LeetCode 69 - Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/), as both involve math operations that require approximation techniques.

11. [LeetCode 1523 - Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/). The logic of finding and summing odd numbers between two boundaries is closely related.

12. [LeetCode 191 - Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/), where the goal is to count the number of `1`s in the binary form of a number.

13. [LeetCode 221 - Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/), which deals with partitioning or working with grids.

14. [LeetCode 1365 - How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/how-many-numbers-are-smaller-than-the-current-number) deals with comparisons and rankings between numbers.

15. [LeetCode 53 - Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/Maximum-Subarray) has a somewhat similar concept of partitioning space and working with boundaries in a more abstract sense.

16. [LeetCode 9 - Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/Palindrome-Number), which also involves manipulating digits and performing checks.

17. [LeetCode 367 - Valid Perfect Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/Valid-perfect-square), where number properties and mathematical problem solving are involved.

18. [LeetCode 50 - Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/), where you calculate powers of numbers.

19. [LeetCode 414 - Third Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/Third-maximum-number/), where the goal is to find the third maximum but can be adapted for second-largest as well.

20. [LeetCode 55 - Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/Jump-Game/), where you calculate possible jumps based on conditions.

21. [LeetCode 1342: Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)  
    Involves simple arithmetic calculations and iterative processes, similar to the physics problem.

22. [LeetCode 794: Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/)  
    This problem involves a mathematical sequence, much like UVa's problem where you work with dynamic sequences.

23. [LeetCode 1281: Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtract-the-product-and-sum-of-digits-of-an-integer/)  
    While this is a straightforward subtraction problem, this LeetCode problem involves subtraction logic in a basic setting.
