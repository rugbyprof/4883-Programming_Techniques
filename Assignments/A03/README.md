## Assignment 3 - Register + Hashmat

#### Due: 09-05-2024 (Thursday @ classtime)

Yes, I know this is a holiday.

## Online Judge Registration

Go to https://onlinejudge.org/ and register with the site. After you register you will need to remember:

- your `username` and
- your `online judge id`.

The id is an integer similar to: `845581` (this is mine). You find it under the `MyAccount` link. After you get registered go and update the class roster with both of those values.

If you don't fix the class roster with those values, then I cannot see what you have turned in. This has the side effect of you getting zeros for all assignments due before you provided me with the proper information.

## Online Judge First Problem

- Number:
  - 10055
- Name:
  - Hashmat the brave warrior
- URL:
  - https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=996
- UDebug
  - https://www.udebug.com/UVa/10055

Read about Hashmat in the provided pdf and make changes to the code below to correctly solve the problem. The code below works, but will not provide a correct answer. This fact will be exposed if you attempt running it with the uDebug input data sets.

### Starter Code

```cpp
/**
* Name
* Course
* Date
*/
#include <iostream>

#define endl "\n"

using namespace std;

int main() {
    long B = 0, A = 0;

    while (cin >> A >> B) {

        // your stuff here

    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `P10055` in your `assignments` folder.
- Place the pdf, your solution code, and any input files you used in this folder.
- Make sure you create an acceptable [README](../../Resources/03-Readmees/README.md) file for this project (presentation is everything!)
- Commit this content to your github repo by the due date.
