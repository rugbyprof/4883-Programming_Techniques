## Presentation - Problem of Your Choice

#### Due: 12-06-2024 (Last Day of Class)

The due date ranges from the week of October 21-25 until the end of the semester.

## Overview

- Choose a problem from Leetcode, Neetcode, Uva Online Judge, or any other source that you find a problem that would be interesting to discuss.
- Interesting means:
  - It is not so simple that the majority of the class can solve it in one sitting.
  - It involves at least one aspect that a small majority of the class would not previously know.
  - It would foster questions and or discussion.
  - That the majority of us would not understand the problem after 1 quick read.
  - You should have to do a little research, and optimally would find some algorithm or cool shortcut to help solve the problem.
- Are these aspects difficult to achieve? Not really, any semi difficult problem fulfills all of these criteria.

## Presentation

- There is no set format.
- The discussion should last 10-15 minutes with the hopes of an extended discussion.
- PPT's are ok but not necessary.
- An outline (like a readme of sorts) that details your approach to the problem is sufficient.
- What aspects am I looking for when you present?
  1. Explain the problem and how you came to find it / choose it.
  2. Use graphics or any imagery to help explain the problem and solution.
  3. Tell the class what your approach was to solving the problem. This should include:
     - what problem solving paradigm did you assume the problem was categorized as. (dp, divide n conquer, brute force, backtracking, etc.)
     - were you correct in you assumption?
     - did you have roadblocks (places you got stuck)?
     - what discoveries did you made to get over a roadblock?
     - discuss any incorrect assumptions you may have made initially.
  4. Discuss your coded solution and any speed ups that you may have discovered.

More to come with questions from the class and clarifications from me.
